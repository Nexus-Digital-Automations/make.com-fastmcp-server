```typescript
private assessCredentialSecurity(credentials: Record<string, unknown>): {
  issues: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
} {
  const issues: string[] = [];
  const recommendations: string[] = [];
  const credentialKeys = Object.keys(credentials || {});
  
  for (const key of credentialKeys) {
    const value = credentials[key];
    if (typeof value === 'string' && value.length > 0) {
      // NIST-compliant password strength validation
      if (key.toLowerCase().includes('password') && value.length < 12) {
        issues.push('Weak password detected');
        recommendations.push('Use passwords with at least 12 characters');
      }
      
      // Test credential detection
      if (key.toLowerCase().includes('secret') && value.startsWith('test_')) {
        issues.push('Test credentials in production');
        recommendations.push('Replace test credentials with production values');
      }
    }
  }
  
  return { issues, recommendations };
}
```

#### **Method 2: validateOAuthScopes()** - Complexity Reduction: -3
```typescript
private validateOAuthScopes(credentials: Record<string, unknown>): {
  issues: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
} {
  const issues: string[] = [];
  const recommendations: string[] = [];
  
  if (credentials.scope) {
    const scopes = (credentials.scope as string).split(' ');
    if (scopes.includes('admin') || scopes.includes('write:all')) {
      issues.push('Excessive permissions detected');
      recommendations.push('Review and limit OAuth scopes to minimum required');
    }
  }
  
  return { issues, recommendations };
}
```

#### **Method 3: assessConnectionAge()** - Complexity Reduction: -2
```typescript
private assessConnectionAge(connection: ConnectionData): {
  issues: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
} {
  const issues: string[] = [];
  const recommendations: string[] = [];
  
  if (connection.createdAt) {
    const ageInDays = (Date.now() - new Date(connection.createdAt).getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
    if (ageInDays > 365) {
      issues.push('Connection is over 1 year old');
      recommendations.push('Consider rotating connection credentials annually');
    }
  }
  
  return { issues, recommendations };
}
```

#### **Method 4: calculateSecurityScore()** - Complexity Reduction: -5
```typescript
private calculateSecurityScore(issues: string[]): {
  score: number;
  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'critical';
} {
  const score = Math.max(0, 100 - (issues.length * 20));
  
  let severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'critical' = 'info';
  if (score < 40) { severity = 'critical'; }
  else if (score < 60) { severity = 'error'; }
  else if (score < 80) { severity = 'warning'; }
  
  return { score, severity };
}
```

### 3.2 Refactored Main Function (Complexity: 8)

```typescript
async function assessConnectionSecurity(connection: ConnectionData): Promise<ConnectionDiagnosticResult> {
  const securityIssues: string[] = [];
  const recommendations: string[] = [];
  
  // Extract Method 1: Credential security assessment (Complexity: 1)
  const credentialResults = this.assessCredentialSecurity(connection.credentials || {});
  securityIssues.push(...credentialResults.issues);
  recommendations.push(...credentialResults.recommendations);
  
  // Extract Method 2: OAuth scope validation (Complexity: 1)
  const oauthResults = this.validateOAuthScopes(connection.credentials || {});
  securityIssues.push(...oauthResults.issues);
  recommendations.push(...oauthResults.recommendations);
  
  // Extract Method 3: Connection age assessment (Complexity: 1)
  const ageResults = this.assessConnectionAge(connection);
  securityIssues.push(...ageResults.issues);
  recommendations.push(...ageResults.recommendations);
  
  // Extract Method 4: Security scoring (Complexity: 1)
  const { score: securityScore, severity } = this.calculateSecurityScore(securityIssues);
  
  // Extract Method 5: Result construction (Complexity: 4)
  return this.buildSecurityResult(connection, securityScore, severity, securityIssues, recommendations);
