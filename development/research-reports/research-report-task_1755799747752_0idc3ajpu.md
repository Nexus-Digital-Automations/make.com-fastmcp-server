**Task ID**: task_1755799747752_0idc3ajpu  
**Implementation Task ID**: task_1755799747751_2th8j7n66  

## Executive Summary

This research provides comprehensive analysis and recommendations for optimizing the test infrastructure to support the newly refactored modular architectures (scenarios, log-streaming, enterprise-secrets). The current test infrastructure shows sophisticated patterns but lacks specific optimization for modular architectures, presenting opportunities for significant improvements in test maintainability, performance, and coverage.

## 1. Current Test Infrastructure Analysis

### 1.1 Existing Test Structure Assessment

**Test Directory Structure**:
- **Comprehensive Organization**: Well-organized test structure with unit, integration, e2e, performance, and security test categories
- **Scenarios Module**: Advanced test infrastructure with dedicated directories for fixtures, helpers, integration, modular, performance, and unit tests
- **Enterprise-Secrets**: Basic unit tests exist but lack modular architecture support
- **Log-Streaming**: No dedicated test files found, indicating gap in test coverage

**Key Findings**:
- **Scenarios Module**: Excellent test infrastructure with 345 lines of sophisticated test utilities and mock factories
- **Test Utilities**: Comprehensive helper functions including assertion helpers, workflow simulators, error testing, and performance utilities
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Well-designed mock factories with API response builders and mock servers
- **Coverage Gaps**: Log-streaming and enterprise-secrets modules lack dedicated modular test infrastructure

### 1.2 Test Configuration Analysis

**Jest Configuration Strengths**:
- TypeScript support with ts-jest
- Comprehensive module name mapping for .js extensions
- Mock system for FastMCP, logger, config, and API client
- Coverage collection configured for 20% global threshold
- Test timeout configured for 30 seconds
- Single worker configuration to avoid Jest worker issues

**Test Infrastructure Components**:
- **Mock Factories**: Sophisticated mock creation patterns in `tests/scenarios/helpers/mock-factories.ts`
- **Test Utilities**: Comprehensive utilities in `tests/scenarios/helpers/test-utils.ts`
- **Fixture Data**: Organized test data in `tests/scenarios/fixtures/scenario-data.ts`
- **Integration Helpers**: API compatibility and tool registration tests

### 1.3 Current Test Patterns

**Successful Patterns Identified**:
1. **Modular Test Organization**: Scenarios module demonstrates excellent separation of concerns
2. **Mock Dependency Injection**: Clean mocking of ToolContext pattern
3. **Assertion Helpers**: Comprehensive assertion utilities for common patterns
4. **Performance Testing**: Built-in utilities for execution time measurement and concurrent operations
5. **Schema Testing**: Dedicated utilities for Zod schema validation testing
6. **Error Scenario Testing**: Comprehensive error handling test patterns

## 2. Modular Architecture Testing Challenges

### 2.1 Identified Challenges

**Module-Specific Testing Challenges**:

**Scenarios Module** (Already Well-Addressed):
- ✅ Comprehensive modular test suite (404 lines) with 21 passing tests
- ✅ Individual tool testing with dependency injection
- ✅ Schema validation testing with proper mocking
- ✅ Integration testing with FastMCP compatibility

**Log-Streaming Module** (Significant Gaps):
- ❌ No dedicated modular test infrastructure
- ❌ Missing tests for real-time streaming functionality
- ❌ No testing for external system integrations
- ❌ Lack of event emitter and streaming-specific test patterns

**Enterprise-Secrets Module** (Major Optimization Needed):
- ❌ Only basic unit tests (50 lines) for monolithic structure
- ❌ No tests for new modular architecture (26 TypeScript files)
- ❌ Missing security-focused testing patterns
- ❌ No tests for HSM integration, Vault operations, or audit logging
- ❌ Lack of compliance-focused test scenarios

### 2.2 Cross-Module Testing Challenges

**Integration Testing Gaps**:
- Limited cross-module interaction testing
- Missing test patterns for modular tool composition
- Insufficient testing of shared utilities and types
- Lack of consistent testing patterns across all three modules

**Performance Testing Gaps**:
- No benchmarking for modular architecture benefits
- Missing load time optimization testing
- Insufficient concurrent execution testing across modules

## 3. Industry Best Practices for Modular Testing
