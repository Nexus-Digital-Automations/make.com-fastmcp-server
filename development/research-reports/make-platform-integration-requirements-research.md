- Multiple community-built MCP servers available on GitHub
- Integration with various external services and APIs
- Open-source implementations provide reference architectures

### 4. Production Deployment Requirements

#### Scalability Standards
- **Rate Limiting**: Conservative 50 requests/minute for production
- **Distributed Systems**: Support for load balancing across multiple instances
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: Automatic failure recovery and resilience
- **Caching Strategies**: Intelligent request caching and response optimization

#### Security Compliance
- **HTTPS Mandatory**: All production deployments require SSL/TLS
- **Authentication Systems**: JWT-based authentication for server access
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation
- **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive data redaction in logs and responses

#### Monitoring & Observability
- **Health Check Endpoints**: /health, /health/live, /health/ready
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus-compatible metrics
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive operation logging for compliance

#### Container & Orchestration Support
- **Docker Multi-stage Builds**: Optimized production images (180MB final size)
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Production-ready K8s deployment configurations
- **Health Monitoring**: Container health checks and automatic restarts
- **Resource Management**: CPU/memory limits and auto-scaling support

    // Dynamic limit adjustment based on API performance
  }
}

// Add intelligent caching layer
class MakeApiCache {
  async getCached<T>(key: string, factory: () => Promise<T>, ttl: number): Promise<T> {
    // Cache implementation with configurable TTL
  }
}
