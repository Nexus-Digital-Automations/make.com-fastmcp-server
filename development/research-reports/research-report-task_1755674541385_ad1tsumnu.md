## Implementation Pattern Analysis

### 1. Consistent Architecture Patterns

**Tool Registration Pattern**:
```typescript
export function add[Category]Tools(server: FastMCP, apiClient: MakeApiClient): void {
  const componentLogger = logger.child({ component: '[Category]Tools' });
  
  componentLogger.info('Adding [category] tools');
  
  server.addTool({
    name: 'tool-name',
    description: 'Comprehensive tool description',
    parameters: ValidationSchema,
    annotations: { title: 'Tool Title', readOnlyHint: boolean, openWorldHint: boolean },
    execute: async (args, { log, reportProgress, session }) => { /* implementation */ }
  });
}
```

**Input Validation**:
- All tools use **Zod schemas** for comprehensive parameter validation
- Type-safe parameter definitions with descriptions
- Strict validation preventing additional properties
- Custom validation functions for complex business rules

**Error Handling**:
- Consistent `UserError` usage for client-facing errors
- Comprehensive error logging with correlation IDs
- API response validation and error propagation
- Graceful degradation for optional features

**Progress Reporting**:
- Long-running operations implement `reportProgress({ progress, total })`
- Standardized progress tracking from 0-100
- User feedback for operations exceeding expected duration

### 2. Security Implementation

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- Session-based authentication with correlation IDs
- API key validation for server-level authentication
- Permission-based access control with role checking
- Secure credential handling patterns

**Data Security**:
- Input sanitization and validation
- Credential encryption patterns
- Sensitive data masking in responses
- Secure API client with rate limiting

**Audit Logging**:
- Comprehensive operation logging
- User action tracking with timestamps
- Component-level logging with structured data
- Correlation ID tracking for request tracing

### 3. API Integration Patterns

**MakeApiClient Usage**:
```typescript
const response = await apiClient.get('/endpoint', { params });
const response = await apiClient.post('/endpoint', data);
const response = await apiClient.patch('/endpoint', updateData);
const response = await apiClient.delete('/endpoint');

if (!response.success) {
  throw new UserError(`Operation failed: ${response.error?.message}`);
}
```

**Response Handling**:
- Consistent success/error checking
- Metadata extraction for pagination
- Type guards for response validation
- Structured error messages for debugging

**Rate Limiting Integration**:
- Automatic rate limiting through MakeApiClient
- Rate limiter status monitoring
- Graceful handling of rate limit exceeded scenarios
