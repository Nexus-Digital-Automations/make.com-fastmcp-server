## 4. FastMCP Annotation Patterns

### 4.1 Standardized Annotation Combinations

Based on successful enterprise security tool implementations, the following annotation patterns apply:

#### Pattern 1: Safe Read-Only Operations
```typescript
{
  title: 'List Custom Variables',
  readOnlyHint: true,
  destructiveHint: false,
  idempotentHint: true,
  openWorldHint: true
}
```

**Applied to:** list-*, get-*, search-*, export-*, analyze-*, test-*

#### Pattern 2: Idempotent Configuration Operations  
```typescript
{
  title: 'Create Custom Variable',
  readOnlyHint: false,
  destructiveHint: false,
  idempotentHint: true,
  openWorldHint: true
}
```

**Applied to:** create-*, update-*, configure-*, install-*, deploy-*

#### Pattern 3: Non-Idempotent Management Operations
```typescript
{
  title: 'Rotate Credential',
  readOnlyHint: false,
  destructiveHint: false,
  idempotentHint: false,
  openWorldHint: true
}
```

**Applied to:** rotate-*, renew-*, generate-*, increment-*

#### Pattern 4: Destructive Operations
```typescript
{
  title: 'Delete Certificate',
  readOnlyHint: false,
  destructiveHint: true,
  idempotentHint: false,
  openWorldHint: true
}
```

**Applied to:** delete-*, revoke-*, uninstall-*, remove-*, terminate-*

#### Pattern 5: Bulk Operations (Context-Dependent)
```typescript
{
  title: 'Bulk Variable Operations',
  readOnlyHint: false,
  destructiveHint: true, // Due to potential delete operations
  idempotentHint: false,
  openWorldHint: true
}
```

**Applied to:** bulk-* operations with mixed operation types

### 4.2 Specialized Annotation Patterns

  destructiveHint: false,
  idempotentHint: false,
  openWorldHint: true
}
```

#### Validation and Testing Operations
```typescript
{
  title: 'Validate Certificate Chain',
  readOnlyHint: true,
  destructiveHint: false,
  idempotentHint: true,
  openWorldHint: true
}
```

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

### 6.1 Identified Risk Categories

#### High-Risk: Unauthorized Destructive Operations
**Risk Description:** Incorrect annotations on destructive operations could lead to accidental data loss or system damage.

**Specific Risks:**
- `delete-certificate` incorrectly marked as idempotent
- `bulk-variable-operations` with insufficient destructive warnings
- `revoke-certificate` without proper authorization checks

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Double Validation**: All destructive operations require explicit confirmation
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for destructive operation annotations
- **Role-Based Restrictions**: Additional permission checks for destructive operations
- **Backup Requirements**: Mandatory backups before destructive operations

#### Medium-Risk: External Dependency Failures
**Risk Description:** Incorrect `openWorldHint` annotations could impact client decision-making for network-dependent operations.

**Specific Risks:**
- Certificate validation marked as non-network dependent
- SDK marketplace operations without proper network requirements
- Credential store operations with incorrect external dependency flags

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Dependency Mapping**: Comprehensive external dependency documentation
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful handling of external service failures
- **Network Testing**: Regular validation of external dependencies
- **Client Education**: Clear documentation of network requirements

#### Low-Risk: Performance and Usability Impact
**Risk Description:** Inconsistent or incorrect annotations could impact client user experience and tool selection.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Annotation Consistency**: Standardized patterns across similar operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track annotation processing impact
- **User Feedback**: Collect client feedback on annotation effectiveness
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and refinement of annotations

### 6.2 Security Compliance Requirements

**Enterprise Security Standards:**
- **SOX Compliance**: Proper annotation of financial and audit operations
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data handling annotations for variable and credential operations
- **SOC 2 Compliance**: Security control annotations for access management operations
- **ISO 27001 Compliance**: Risk-based annotation classification system

**Implementation Security Measures:**
- **Code Review Process**: Mandatory security review for all destructive operation annotations
- **Penetration Testing**: Security testing of annotated tool behaviors
- **Compliance Auditing**: Regular audit of annotation accuracy and completeness
- **Incident Response**: Clear procedures for annotation-related security incidents
