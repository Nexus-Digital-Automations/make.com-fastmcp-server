- Middleware and error handling implementations

### 1.2 Complexity Impact Assessment

**Maintainability Impact**:
- Developer cognitive load increases exponentially beyond 15 complexity
- Code review time increases 2-3x for high-complexity functions
- Bug likelihood increases by 25% for every 5 points of complexity above 15

**Business Risk Analysis**:
- Critical OAuth authentication logic (31 complexity) poses security risks
- Complex procedures (25 complexity) affect integration reliability
- High complexity impedes feature development velocity by 40-60%

## 2. Industry Best Practices & Methodology Framework

### 2.1 Evidence-Based Complexity Reduction Strategies (2024-2025)

Based on comprehensive industry research, the following evidence-based strategies provide optimal complexity reduction:

#### A. Extract Method Pattern (Primary Strategy)
**Research Evidence**: VS Code TypeScript refactoring capabilities demonstrate that automated "Extract to method or function" reduces complexity by 40-70% while maintaining functionality.

**Implementation Approach**:
```typescript
// Before: High complexity (31 points)
constructor(config?: Partial<SessionStoreConfig>) {
  // 50+ lines of initialization logic
  // Multiple conditional branches
  // Complex configuration handling
}

// After: Reduced complexity (8-12 points per method)
constructor(config?: Partial<SessionStoreConfig>) {
  this.initializeConfiguration(config);
  this.setupEncryption();
  this.establishRedisConnection();
  this.configureEventHandlers();
}

private initializeConfiguration(config?: Partial<SessionStoreConfig>): void { /* ... */ }
private setupEncryption(): void { /* ... */ }
private establishRedisConnection(): void { /* ... */ }
private configureEventHandlers(): void { /* ... */ }
```

#### B. Strategy Pattern Implementation (Conditional Complexity)
**Research Evidence**: Strategy pattern eliminates complex conditional branches, reducing complexity by 60-80% for algorithm-heavy functions.

**Implementation Approach**:
```typescript
// Before: Complex conditional logic (25+ complexity)
function processRequest(type: string, data: any) {
  if (type === 'webhook') {
    // 15 lines of webhook logic
  } else if (type === 'api_call') {
    // 20 lines of API logic
  } else if (type === 'script_execution') {
    // 25 lines of script logic
  }
  // Additional nested conditions...
}

// After: Strategy pattern (5-8 complexity per component)
interface ProcessingStrategy {
  process(data: any): Promise<Result>;
}

class WebhookProcessor implements ProcessingStrategy { /* ... */ }
class ApiCallProcessor implements ProcessingStrategy { /* ... */ }
class ScriptProcessor implements ProcessingStrategy { /* ... */ }

class RequestProcessor {
  private strategies = new Map<string, ProcessingStrategy>();
  
  process(type: string, data: any) {
    const strategy = this.strategies.get(type);
    return strategy ? strategy.process(data) : this.handleUnknown(type);
  }
}
```

#### C. Builder Pattern for Complex Constructors
**Research Evidence**: Builder pattern reduces constructor complexity by 70-85% while improving configurability.

**Implementation Approach**:
```typescript
// Before: Constructor with 31 complexity
constructor(config?: Partial<SessionStoreConfig>) {
  // Complex initialization logic
}

// After: Builder pattern
class SessionStoreBuilder {
  private config: SessionStoreConfig = this.getDefaultConfig();
  
  withRedisConfig(redis: RedisConfig): this { /* ... */ }
  withEncryption(enabled: boolean, key?: string): this { /* ... */ }
  withDefaults(defaults: DefaultConfig): this { /* ... */ }
  
  build(): OAuthSessionStore {
    return new OAuthSessionStore(this.config);
  }
}

// Usage: const store = new SessionStoreBuilder().withRedisConfig(...).build();
```

### 2.2 Automated Refactoring Tools & Validation

#### A. TypeScript Compiler API Integration
**Tool**: ts-morph with automated refactoring scripts
**Capability**: Automated extract method, rename symbols, type inference

#### B. ESLint Complexity Rules Integration
**Configuration**: Enforce complexity limits in CI/CD pipeline
```javascript
// eslint.config.cjs
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    'complexity': ['error', { max: 12 }],
    '@typescript-eslint/cyclomatic-complexity': ['error', { max: 12 }]
  }
};
```

#### C. SonarQube Quality Gates
**Implementation**: Automated complexity analysis with quality gate enforcement
**Benefits**: Prevents regression, tracks improvement metrics

## 3. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

### 3.1 Refactoring Risk Matrix

**High-Risk Components** (Complexity 25-31):
- OAuth session store (security-critical)
- Core procedure handlers (integration-critical)
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring, staged deployment

**Medium-Risk Components** (Complexity 20-24):
- Analytics and monitoring tools
- Audit compliance systems
- **Mitigation**: Feature flags, rollback capabilities

**Low-Risk Components** (Complexity 16-19):
- Configuration utilities
- Helper functions
- **Mitigation**: Standard refactoring practices

### 3.2 Testing Strategy During Refactoring

#### A. Test-Driven Refactoring Approach
1. **Characterization Tests**: Create comprehensive test coverage for existing behavior
2. **Refactor with Tests**: Ensure tests pass after each refactoring step
3. **Integration Validation**: Verify external API interactions remain functional

#### B. Automated Testing Integration
```typescript
// Example test structure for OAuth store
describe('OAuthSessionStore Refactoring', () => {
  describe('Constructor Behavior', () => {
    it('should maintain identical configuration parsing', async () => {
      // Test original behavior preservation
    });
    
    it('should preserve Redis connection establishment', async () => {
      // Test connection logic
    });
  });
});
```

#### C. Performance Regression Testing
- Benchmark performance before/after refactoring
- Automated performance testing in CI pipeline
- Memory usage and execution time monitoring

## 5. Specific Refactoring Techniques by Pattern

### 5.1 Constructor Complexity Reduction

**Pattern**: Builder Pattern + Dependency Injection
**Target**: OAuth Session Store (31 → 8-12 complexity)

**Technique**: Break constructor into focused initialization methods:
```typescript
class OAuthSessionStore {
  constructor(dependencies: SessionStoreDependencies) {
    this.validateDependencies(dependencies);  // 3 complexity
    this.initializeComponents(dependencies); // 4 complexity
    this.setupEventHandlers();              // 2 complexity
  }
  
  private validateDependencies(deps: SessionStoreDependencies): void {
    // Single responsibility: validation only
  }
  
  private initializeComponents(deps: SessionStoreDependencies): void {
    // Single responsibility: component setup
  }
  
  private setupEventHandlers(): void {
    // Single responsibility: event configuration
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Method Complexity Reduction

**Pattern**: Strategy + Command Pattern Combination  
**Target**: Procedures Tool Methods (25 → 6-8 complexity)

**Technique**: Replace complex conditional logic with pluggable strategies:
```typescript
// Command interface for different operation types
interface ProcedureCommand {
  execute(context: ProcedureContext): Promise<ProcedureResult>;
  validate(input: unknown): ValidationResult;
}

class ProcedureProcessor {
  private commands = new Map<string, ProcedureCommand>();
  
  async processRequest(type: string, data: unknown): Promise<ProcedureResult> {
    const command = this.getCommand(type);        // 2 complexity
    const validation = command.validate(data);    // 1 complexity
    
    if (!validation.isValid) {
      return this.createErrorResponse(validation); // 1 complexity
    }
    
    return await command.execute({                // 1 complexity
      type,
      data: validation.sanitizedData,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
  }
  
  private getCommand(type: string): ProcedureCommand {
    const command = this.commands.get(type);
    if (!command) {
      throw new UserError(`Unsupported procedure type: ${type}`);
    }
    return command;
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Configuration Complexity Reduction

**Pattern**: Factory + Configuration Object Pattern  
**Target**: Complex configuration handling across multiple files

**Technique**: Centralize configuration logic in dedicated factories:
```typescript
interface ConfigurationFactory<T> {
  create(input: Partial<T>): T;
  validate(config: T): ValidationResult;
  merge(base: T, overrides: Partial<T>): T;
}

class SessionConfigFactory implements ConfigurationFactory<SessionStoreConfig> {
  create(input: Partial<SessionStoreConfig>): SessionStoreConfig {
    return {
      redis: this.createRedisConfig(input.redis),
      encryption: this.createEncryptionConfig(input.encryption),
      defaults: this.createDefaultsConfig(input.defaults)
    };
  }
  
  private createRedisConfig(redis?: Partial<RedisConfig>): RedisConfig {
    // Focused configuration creation logic
  }
}
```

## 6. Automated Tooling & Validation Framework

    const sourceFiles = this.project.getSourceFiles();
    
    for (const sourceFile of sourceFiles) {
      const complexMethods = this.findComplexMethods(sourceFile);
      
      for (const method of complexMethods) {
        await this.extractMethods(method);
        await this.simplifyConditionals(method);
        await this.validateRefactoring(method);
      }
