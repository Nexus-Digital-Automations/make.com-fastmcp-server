  parameters: z.object({
    timeRange: z.object({
      start: z.string().describe('Start timestamp (ISO 8601)'),
      end: z.string().describe('End timestamp (ISO 8601)')
    }),
    filters: z.object({
      scenarios: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
      levels: z.array(z.enum(['error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug'])).optional(),
      modules: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
      searchText: z.string().optional()
    }).optional(),
    aggregation: z.object({
      groupBy: z.enum(['time', 'scenario', 'level', 'module']).optional(),
      interval: z.enum(['1m', '5m', '15m', '1h', '1d']).optional(),
      metrics: z.array(z.enum(['count', 'avg_duration', 'error_rate'])).optional()
    }).optional(),
    format: z.enum(['json', 'csv', 'parquet']).default('json'),
    limit: z.number().max(10000).default(1000)
  }),
  execute: async (params, { log, reportProgress }) => {
    // Implementation with hybrid query routing
  }
});
```
