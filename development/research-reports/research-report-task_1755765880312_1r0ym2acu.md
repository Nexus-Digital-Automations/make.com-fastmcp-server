```typescript
annotations: {
  title: 'Security Assessment Query',
  readOnlyHint: true,
  openWorldHint: true, // if external security services involved
}
```

#### Pattern B: Configuration/Update Operations  
```typescript
annotations: {
  title: 'Security Policy Configuration',
  readOnlyHint: false,
  idempotentHint: true,
  openWorldHint: true,
}
```

#### Pattern C: Destructive Security Operations
```typescript
annotations: {
  title: 'Credential Revocation',
  readOnlyHint: false,
  destructiveHint: true,
  idempotentHint: true,
  openWorldHint: true,
}
```

## 3. Implementation Guidance and Best Practices

### 3.1 Security-Specific Annotation Requirements

#### Critical Security Guidelines:
1. **All destructive operations MUST be marked with `destructiveHint: true`**
2. **External security service integrations MUST use `openWorldHint: true`**
3. **User-facing operations MUST have clear, descriptive titles**
4. **Credential operations require the highest level of annotation precision**

#### Security Operation Categories:

**Category 1: Authentication Operations**
- Login/logout: `readOnlyHint: false`, `openWorldHint: true`
- MFA setup: `readOnlyHint: false`, `idempotentHint: true`
- Session validation: `readOnlyHint: true`
- User lockout: `destructiveHint: true`

**Category 2: Authorization Operations**  
- Permission queries: `readOnlyHint: true`
- Access grant/revoke: `destructiveHint: true`
- Policy updates: `idempotentHint: true`

**Category 3: Secrets Management**
- Secret retrieval: `readOnlyHint: true`
- Secret creation: `idempotentHint: true`
- Secret deletion: `destructiveHint: true`
- Vault operations: External dependency marking required

### 3.2 Tool-Specific Implementation Plans

#### Zero Trust Authentication Tools:
```typescript
// Example for authentication tool
{
  name: 'zero_trust_authenticate',
  annotations: {
    title: 'Zero Trust User Authentication',
    readOnlyHint: false,
    openWorldHint: true, // External identity providers
  }
}

// Example for destructive operation
{
  name: 'terminate_user_sessions',
  annotations: {
    title: 'Terminate All User Sessions',
    readOnlyHint: false,
    destructiveHint: true,
    idempotentHint: true,
    openWorldHint: true,
  }
}
```

#### Multi-Tenant Security Tools:
```typescript
// Example for policy enforcement
{
  name: 'enforce_security_policy',
  annotations: {
    title: 'Enforce Multi-Tenant Security Policy',
    readOnlyHint: false,
    destructiveHint: true, // May revoke access
    idempotentHint: true,
    openWorldHint: false, // Internal system
  }
}
```

#### Enterprise Secrets Tools:
```typescript
// Example for HSM operations
{
  name: 'configure_hsm_vault',
  annotations: {
    title: 'Configure Hardware Security Module',
    readOnlyHint: false,
    idempotentHint: true,
    openWorldHint: true, // External HSM services
  }
}
```
