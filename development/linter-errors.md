‚ùå **Line undefined:undefined** - Parsing error: ESLint was configured to run on `<tsconfigRootDir>/temp-lint-test.ts` using `parserOptions.project`: /users/jeremyparker/desktop/claude coding projects/make.com-fastmcp-server/tsconfig.json
However, that TSConfig does not include this file. Either:
- Change ESLint's list of included files to not include this file
- Change that TSConfig to include this file
- Create a new TSConfig that includes this file and include it in your parserOptions.project
