## 🚀 Technical Implementation Details

### Dependency Monitoring Architecture

```typescript
// Core classes implemented
- DependencyMonitor: Vulnerability scanning and package analysis
- MaintenanceReportGenerator: Comprehensive report generation with multi-format export
- VulnerabilityAlert: Security vulnerability data structure
- OutdatedPackage: Package update information structure
- MaintenanceReport: Comprehensive maintenance report format
```

### Security Scanning Integration

```typescript
// Multi-tool scanning approach (from research recommendations)
Primary Tool: npm audit (zero dependencies, native Node.js)
Enhanced Tools: AuditJS/Snyk integration ready (cost-effective security)
Scanning Methods:
  - performVulnerabilityScan(): Primary npm audit scanning
  - checkOutdatedPackages(): Package update analysis
  - performComprehensiveScan(): Complete dependency analysis
```

### FastMCP Tool Examples

```bash
# Scan for critical vulnerabilities only
scan-vulnerabilities --severity_filter critical

# Check for major package updates
check-outdated-packages --update_type major

# Generate comprehensive maintenance report in Markdown
generate-maintenance-report --format markdown --include_details true

# Get current dependency health status
get-dependency-health-status
```

## 📊 Current Project Status Assessment
