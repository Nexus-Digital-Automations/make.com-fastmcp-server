## üéØ Best Practices for Claude Desktop Integration

### 1. Clear Commands

**Good:**
- "Show me failed executions from last week"
- "Create a Slack connection for the marketing team"
- "Clone the production scenario for testing"

**Better:**
- "Show me failed executions from last week for scenarios in team 123"
- "Create a Slack connection named 'Marketing Team' for workspace 'company' with bot token from our credentials"
- "Clone scenario 456 with name 'TEST - Production Scenario' to team 789 and set it inactive"

### 2. Context Awareness

```text
User: "I'm having issues with my customer sync scenario"

Claude: I'd be happy to help with your customer sync scenario. Let me first identify which scenario you're referring to and check its current status.

[Claude searches for scenarios with "customer sync" in the name, shows options if multiple found, then proceeds with diagnostics]
```

### 3. Multi-Step Operations

```text
User: "I need to migrate all scenarios from the old team to the new team"

Claude: I'll help you migrate scenarios from the old team to the new team. This will involve several steps:

1. First, let me list all scenarios in the old team
2. Create clones in the new team
3. Update any team-specific variables
4. Test the migrated scenarios
5. Deactivate old scenarios once confirmed working

Let me start by identifying the scenarios to migrate...

[Claude executes each step systematically, providing updates and asking for confirmation where needed]
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Issues

```text
User: "Claude can't access my Make.com data"

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Check API key configuration in Claude Desktop config
2. Verify Make.com API permissions
3. Test server connectivity
4. Check rate limiting status

Claude: Let me help troubleshoot the connection. First, I'll check if the FastMCP server is responding...

[Uses health-check tool to diagnose issues]
```

### Performance Issues

```text
User: "Commands are taking too long to execute"

Common causes:
1. Large data sets without pagination
2. Complex scenario blueprints
3. Network latency
4. Rate limiting delays

Claude: I notice the commands are slow. Let me check the server performance and suggest optimizations...

[Uses server-info and performance metrics to identify bottlenecks]
```

### Permission Errors

```text
User: "Getting permission denied errors"

Solutions:
1. Verify API key has required permissions
2. Check team/organization access rights
3. Confirm user roles and permissions
4. Update authentication configuration

[Uses get-current-user and related tools to diagnose permission issues]
```

## üìö Advanced Integration Patterns

### Custom Workflows with Claude

```typescript
// Example: Custom business logic with Claude integration
interface BusinessRule {
  condition: string;
  action: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}

const workflowRules: BusinessRule[] = [
  {
    condition: "execution_time > 300s",
    action: "notify_admin",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    condition: "error_rate > 5%",
    action: "pause_scenario",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    condition: "success_rate < 90%",
    action: "send_report",
    priority: "medium"
  }
];

// Claude can interpret these rules and take appropriate actions
```

### Integration with Other Tools

```text
User: "Integrate this with our Jira ticketing system for error tracking"

Claude: I'll help you set up integration with Jira for automated error tracking:

1. Create custom variables for Jira configuration
2. Set up notification templates for error tickets
3. Configure webhooks for automatic ticket creation
4. Test the integration with a sample error

[Claude creates the necessary configuration and tests the integration]
```
