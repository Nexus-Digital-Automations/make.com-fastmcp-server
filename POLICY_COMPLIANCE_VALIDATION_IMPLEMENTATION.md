## Key Implementation Components

### 1. Validation Target System

```typescript
interface ValidationTarget {
  targetType: 'scenario' | 'connection' | 'template' | 'folder' | 'user' | 'data_flow' | 'organization' | 'team';
  targetId: string;
  targetName?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

Supports validation of multiple target types with flexible metadata for context-aware validation.

### 2. Policy Selection and Filtering

```typescript
interface PolicySelection {
  policyTypes?: ['compliance', 'naming_convention', 'scenario_archival'];
  policyIds?: string[];
  frameworks?: ['sox', 'gdpr', 'hipaa', 'pci_dss', 'iso27001', 'enterprise', 'custom'];
  organizationId?: number;
  teamId?: number;
  tags?: string[];
  excludePolicyIds?: string[];
  activeOnly?: boolean;
}
```

Flexible policy selection system allowing fine-grained control over which policies to validate against.

### 3. Advanced Validation Options

```typescript
interface ValidationOptions {
  includeRecommendations: boolean;
  includeComplianceScore: boolean;
  includeViolationDetails: boolean;
  enableCrossValidation: boolean;
  scoringWeights?: {
    compliance: number;
    naming: number;
    archival: number;
  };
  severityThresholds?: {
    critical: number;
    high: number;
    medium: number;
    low: number;
  };
  validationDepth: 'basic' | 'standard' | 'comprehensive';
}
```

Comprehensive configuration options for customizing validation behavior and output detail level.

### 4. Compliance Violation Definition

```typescript
interface PolicyViolation {
  violationId: string;
  policyType: PolicyType;
  policyId: string;
  policyName: string;
  violationType: string;
  severity: ViolationSeverity;
  description: string;
  affectedTargets: string[];
  framework?: ComplianceFramework;
  controlId?: string;
  riskScore: number;
  complianceScore: number;
  detectedAt: string;
  recommendations: string[];
  remediationSteps: Array<{
    step: string;
    priority: RemediationPriority;
    estimatedEffort: string;
    automatable: boolean;
  }>;
  relatedViolations: string[];
  exemptionEligible: boolean;
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

Rich violation data structure capturing all relevant information for compliance tracking and remediation.

### 5. Cross-Validation System

The implementation includes sophisticated cross-validation logic that detects:

- **Policy Conflicts**: Conflicting requirements between different policy types
- **High Violation Load**: Targets with excessive violations across multiple policies
- **Archival vs Active Conflicts**: Scenarios marked for archival but needing active policy compliance

### 6. Scoring Algorithm

The compliance scoring system uses weighted calculations:

```typescript
// Default weights (customizable)
const defaultWeights = {
  compliance: 0.4,    // 40% weight for compliance policies
  naming: 0.3,        // 30% weight for naming conventions
  archival: 0.3,      // 30% weight for archival policies
};

// Overall score calculation
overallScore = Σ(policyScore × weight) / totalWeight
```

### 7. Remediation Workflow System

Automated generation of prioritized remediation steps:

- **Immediate Priority**: Critical violations requiring immediate attention
- **High Priority**: High-severity violations with significant compliance impact
- **Medium Priority**: Framework-specific and policy-type improvements
- **Low Priority**: General compliance posture enhancements

## API Usage Examples

### Basic Scenario Validation

```typescript
const validation = await validatePolicyCompliance({
  targets: [{
    targetType: "scenario",
    targetId: "scenario_123",
    targetName: "Customer Data Processing"
  }],
  policySelection: {
    frameworks: ["gdpr", "sox"],
    activeOnly: true
  },
  validationOptions: {
    validationDepth: "comprehensive",
    enableCrossValidation: true
  }
});
```

### Batch Organization Validation

```typescript
const validation = await validatePolicyCompliance({
  targets: [
    { targetType: "organization", targetId: "org_456" },
    { targetType: "team", targetId: "team_789" }
  ],
  policySelection: {
    policyTypes: ["compliance", "naming_convention", "scenario_archival"],
    frameworks: ["sox", "gdpr", "hipaa"],
    organizationId: 456
  },
  validationOptions: {
    includeRecommendations: true,

    scoringWeights: {
      compliance: 0.5,
      naming: 0.3,
      archival: 0.2
    }
  }
});
```

### Custom Framework Validation

```typescript
const validation = await validatePolicyCompliance({
  targets: [{ targetType: "data_flow", targetId: "flow_321" }],
  policySelection: {
    frameworks: ["pci_dss", "iso27001"],
    tags: ["financial", "security"]
  },
  validationOptions: {
    validationDepth: "comprehensive",
    severityThresholds: {
      critical: 95,
      high: 80,
      medium: 60,
      low: 30
    }
  },
  reportingOptions: {
    format: "executive",
