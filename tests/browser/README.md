# Browser Tests with Staged Loading Sequences

This directory contains browser-based end-to-end tests that implement proper loading sequences to prevent race conditions and system overload during testing.

## üéØ User Requirements Addressed

The browser tests implement the specific requirements:

1. **"Workflows load first before clicking buttons"** - All tests wait for workflow elements to be fully loaded before any interactions
2. **"Performance dashboard loads after workflows"** - Staged approach ensures workflows are ready before dashboard navigation
3. **"Proper loading detection"** - Comprehensive loading state detection prevents premature interactions
4. **"System overload prevention"** - Stress detection and backoff mechanisms protect system stability

## üèóÔ∏è Test Architecture

### Loading Sequence Helpers (`loading-sequence-helpers.ts`)

Provides comprehensive utilities for staged loading:

- **`waitForElementsToLoad()`** - Wait for basic page elements and loading indicators
- **`waitForWorkflowsLoaded()`** - Ensure workflows, scenarios, and connections are ready
- **`waitForDashboardReady()`** - Wait for dashboard, charts, and data visualization
- **`safeClick()`** - Click elements only when fully loaded and enabled
- **`safeNavigate()`** - Navigate between views with proper loading sequences
- **`detectSystemStress()`** - Monitor system health and loading performance
- **`waitWithBackoff()`** - Retry operations with intelligent backoff on stress

### Test Files

#### `staged-workflow.test.ts`

## üöÄ Running Browser Tests

### Command Options

```bash
# Run all browser tests
npm run test:browser

# Run staging sequence tests
npm run test:browser:staging

# Run dashboard workflow sequence tests  
npm run test:browser:dashboard

# Run tests in debug mode (breakpoints, slow-mo)
npm run test:browser:debug

# Run tests with visible browser (headed mode)
npm run test:browser:headed

# View detailed test reports
npm run test:browser:report
```

### Direct Playwright Commands

```bash
# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/browser/staged-workflow.test.ts

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run in debug mode with breakpoints
npx playwright test --debug

# Generate and view report
npx playwright test && npx playwright show-report
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Playwright Config (`playwright.config.ts`)

Optimized for staged loading tests:
- Extended timeouts (60s per test, 30s for assertions)
- Limited concurrent workers to prevent overload
- Screenshot/video capture on failures
- Trace collection for debugging
- Development server integration

### Loading Configuration

Tests use comprehensive loading configuration:

```typescript
const LOADING_CONFIG = {
  timeout: 60000,           // Extended timeout for complex pages
  debugLogging: true,       // Detailed logging for troubleshooting
  waitForCharts: true,      // Wait for data visualizations
  waitForData: true,        // Wait for data tables/lists
  waitForScenarios: true,   // Wait for workflow scenarios
  waitForConnections: true, // Wait for connection lists
  stagingDelay: 2000       // Delay between stages
};
```

## üìä Test Execution Flow

### 1. Staged Loading Sequence

```
Basic Page Load ‚Üí Workflows ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Interactions
       ‚Üì              ‚Üì          ‚Üì           ‚Üì
  - DOM ready     - Scenarios  - Charts   - Safe clicks
  - Network idle  - Connections - Data    - Form inputs  
  - Loading gone  - Templates   - Metrics - Navigation
```

### 2. System Health Monitoring

- **Stress Detection**: Monitor error indicators and network timing
- **Backoff Strategy**: Implement delays when system shows stress
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Graceful handling of loading failures
- **Performance Tracking**: Measure and validate loading times

### 3. Error Handling

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient failures
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Alternative approaches when primary methods fail
- **Screenshot Capture**: Visual debugging for test failures
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs for troubleshooting

## üîç Debugging Browser Tests

### Debug Mode
```bash
npm run test:browser:debug
```
- Opens browser with DevTools
- Allows setting breakpoints in test code
- Step-through execution
- Manual inspection of page state

### Headed Mode
```bash
npm run test:browser:headed
```
- Visible browser window during test execution
- Watch real-time test interactions
- Observe loading sequences visually
- Identify timing issues

### Test Reports
```bash
npm run test:browser:report
```
- Detailed HTML report with screenshots
- Timeline of test execution
- Network activity logs
- Error traces and stack traces

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tests Timing Out
- **Issue**: Loading sequences take longer than expected
- **Solution**: Increase timeout in test configuration or verify application performance

#### Elements Not Found
- **Issue**: Page structure doesn't match expected selectors
- **Solution**: Update selectors in loading helpers or add fallback approaches

#### System Overload
- **Issue**: Tests run too fast and overwhelm the application
- **Solution**: Stress detection automatically handles this, but can adjust staging delays

#### Flaky Tests
- **Issue**: Tests pass/fail inconsistently
- **Solution**: Use staged loading helpers and stress detection for more reliable tests

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Run single test with full logging
npx playwright test tests/browser/staged-workflow.test.ts --headed --debug

# Generate trace file for analysis
npx playwright test --trace=on

# Run tests with specific timeout
npx playwright test --timeout=120000
```

## üìà Performance Expectations

### Loading Time Targets

- **Basic Page Load**: < 10 seconds
- **Workflow Loading**: < 20 seconds
- **Dashboard Loading**: < 30 seconds
- **Complete Sequence**: < 60 seconds

### System Health Indicators

- **Network Idle**: < 5 seconds
- **Stress Recovery**: < 10 seconds
- **Error Rate**: < 5%
- **Retry Success**: > 95%

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

### CI Configuration

Browser tests are designed to run in CI environments:
- Headless mode by default
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Artifact collection (screenshots, videos, traces)
- Performance monitoring and reporting

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Skip web server startup (if already running)
SKIP_WEBSERVER=true

# Enable headed mode for debugging
HEADED=true

# Set base URL for testing
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Configure Playwright browsers path
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/path/to/browsers
```

## üìù Best Practices

### Writing New Tests

1. **Always use loading helpers** - Don't wait with arbitrary timeouts
2. **Implement staging** - Follow workflows ‚Üí dashboard ‚Üí interactions pattern
3. **Add stress detection** - Use `waitWithBackoff()` for critical operations
4. **Provide fallbacks** - Multiple approaches for finding elements
5. **Log extensively** - Enable debug logging for troubleshooting

### Test Maintenance

1. **Update selectors** - Keep element selectors synchronized with UI changes
2. **Monitor performance** - Track loading times and adjust expectations
3. **Review failures** - Analyze failed test reports to identify patterns
4. **Stress test regularly** - Verify system handles test load appropriately
