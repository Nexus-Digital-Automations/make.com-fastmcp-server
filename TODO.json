These are high-priority tools that handle financial operations and access control, requiring proper security annotations.\n\n**Research Objectives:**\n1. Investigate best practices and methodologies for this implementation\n2. Identify potential challenges, risks, and mitigation strategies  \n3. Research relevant technologies, frameworks, and tools\n4. Define implementation approach and architecture decisions\n5. Provide actionable recommendations and guidance\n\n**Implementation Task ID:** task_1755766251654_tgrya10lb\n\n**Auto-created by:** TaskManager research dependency system\n**Research Priority:** This research task must be completed before implementation begins",
